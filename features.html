  <h1>Can coffee make</br> you super human?</h1>

  <div id="p1">
    <p>Roasting coffee transforms the chemical and physical properties of green
    coffee beans into roasted coffee products. The roasting process is what
    produces the characteristic flavor of coffee by causing the green coffee
    beans to change in taste. Unroasted beans contain similar if not higher
    levels of acids, protein, sugars, and caffeine as those that have been
    roasted, but lack the taste of roasted coffee beans due to the Maillard
    and other chemical reactions that occur during roasting.</p>

  <h1 id="p-process">Process</h1>

  <p class="process">The vast majority of coffee is roasted commercially on a large scale, but
  small-scale commercial roasting has grown significantly with the trend toward
  “single-origin” coffees served at specialty shops. Some coffee drinkers even
  roast coffee at home as a hobby in order to both experiment with the flavor
  profile of the beans and ensure themselves of the freshest possible roast.</p>

  <p class="process">The coffee-roasting process follows coffee processing and precedes coffee
  brewing. It consists essentially of sorting, roasting, cooling, and packaging
  but can also include grinding in larger-scale roasting houses. In larger
  operations, bags of green coffee beans are hand- or machine-opened, dumped into a hopper, and
  screened to remove debris. The green beans are then weighed and transferred by belt or pneumatic conveyor
  to storage hoppers. From the storage hoppers, the green beans are conveyed to the roaster. Initially, the
  process is endothermic (absorbing heat), but at around 175 °C (347 °F) it becomes exothermic (giving off heat).
  For the roaster, this means that the beans are heating themselves and an adjustment of the roaster’s heat source
  might be required. At the end of the roasting cycle, the roasted beans are dumped from the roasting chamber and
  air cooled with a draft inducer.</p>

  <h1 id="p-equipment">Equipment</h1>

  <p class="equipment">The most common roasting machines are of two basic types: drum and hot-air,
  although there are others including packed-bed, tangential and centrifugal
  roasters. Roasters can operate in either batch or continuous modes. Home roasters
  are also available.</p>

  <p class="equipment">Drum machines consist of horizontal rotating drums that
  tumble the green coffee beans in a heated environment. The heat source can be
  supplied by natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), electricity, or even
  wood. The most common employ indirectly heated drums where the heat source is
  under the drum. Direct-fired roasters are roasters in which a flame contacts
  the beans inside the drum; very few of these machines are still in operation.</p>

  </div>

  <p class="equipment">Hot-air roasters force heated air through a screen or perforated
  plate under the coffee beans with sufficient force to lift the beans. Heat is
  transferred to the beans as they tumble and circulate within this fluidized bed.
  Some coffee roasters use names for the various degrees of roast, such as City Roast
  and French Roast, for the internal bean temperatures found during roasting.</p>
